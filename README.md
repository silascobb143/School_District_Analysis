### School_District_Analysis
#Overview of the school district analysis:
- The purpose behind this analysis was to remove the 9th grade scores from the 15 reading and math scores accross the district.  The reason for this was because there was possible grade alterations across the 9th grade.


#Results:
- When we removed the 9th grade scores from THS the overall affect to the district was only slight.  It did not have a large enough number of students to see a large impact.  
-As for THS we see that their averages when compared to the other schools in the district are a little higher.  
-Another thing that changed when we altered the THS class is we relaced some of the scores with NaN.
-Once the 9th grade was taken out of the district and THS scores we saw the largest affects come to THS as an individual school compared to the district.



#Summary
-In summary when we removed the 9th grade scores for reading and math from THS we only see small changes to the overall scores within the district.  
-Additionally some of those scores that were taken out got changed to NaN so the would not be counted.
